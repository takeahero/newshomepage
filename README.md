### What I learned

This is my first time using grid. I'm learn how positioning the grid, with the `grid-template-areas`  

```
    main {
        display: grid;
        grid-template-areas: 
        "main"
        "new"
        "popular";
        grid-template-columns: 33.33% 33.33% 33.33%;
        grid-template-rows: 33.33% 33.33% 33.33%;
    }

    .section__main {
        grid-area: main;
        grid-row: 1/1;
        grid-column: 1/3;
        margin-right: 1rem;
    }

    .section__new {
        grid-area: new;
        grid-row: 1/2;
        grid-column: 3/4;
        margin: 0;
        margin-left: 1rem;
    }

    .section__popular {
        grid-area: popular;
        grid-row: 2/3;
        grid-column: 1/4;
    }

```

### Continued development

The next step is build the another pages.
